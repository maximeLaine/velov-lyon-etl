The goal of this project is to gather some data around in bicycle for the Lyon area and create a visualization on Tableau Public.


## Context
- Create a entire data project, with the following constraints :
    - Extract data from a Data source
    - Process that data and transfer it to a Data Warehouse 
    - Plug Tableau to that Data Warehouse
    - Build a Dashboard that showcase this Data in real-time

- As we are using the Tableau Public, we will need to :
  - Build an ETL to dump data to Google sheets
  - Connect Tableau directly to Google Sheets
